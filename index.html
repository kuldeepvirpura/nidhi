                <p class="text-justify col-6">I took admission in one of the prestigious schools in Vadodara, Prince Ashokraje Gaekwad school. It is located in Manjalpur. It was established by the Highness of Vadodara in the memory of her late husband, Prince Ashokraje Gaekwad (Grandson
                    of King Sayajirao Gaekwad). I have been studying in the school since nursery and I have a very special bonding with the school, as it provides a very friendly and studious environment. Many religious functions are organized by our
                    school, such as Rath Yatra, Guru Purnima, Christmas, etc. Along with the studies we get a lot of knowledge through various projects given to us. Teachers in this school are amazing, they always make the subject more interesting while
                    teaching. Our school has two parts, one is till Senior Kindergarten, it is named after the queen of Vadodara, Rani Devyaniraje Gaekwad. And the other part is from 1st standard till 12th standard and is named after the late Prince,
                    Prince Ashokraje Gaekwad. We also have lot of sporting facilities such as, basketball, volleyball, gymnastic, etc. Our school provides affordable education. It concentrates on the holistic development of a child. Link of School Website:

Its drawing was put on the display board next day. The kid was my daughter, Nidhee. She has grown up now and her wings of capabilities have also spread. I am proud to be her father as she has surpassed many of my expectations. No doubt she is naughty, may be demanding at sometimes due to her age, but at the same time she has very good understanding and remains updated with her studies and responsibilities. I can only say that I could have not asked for much better daughter to the God than her.</i></p>

Now, she has grown up, but still I have to convince her about food as she has become very choosy now. She has achieved many accomplishments in her school life, which make me very proud. I have also got a good friend now in the form of my daughter as she understands the society and the people very well. She helps me in cooking as well as in my routine work and I pray the God to fulfill her all wishes and keep her happy in her life.</i></p>

One thing I learnt from her is that she is very punctual and she does all her homework on time and keeps all her work up to date. Whenever I ask her to hang out with  me she first of all completes all her work and only after then she comes. I love the way she talks. She talks very politely, and smiles and greets anyone coming. A few best moments we share together are: Navratri, Holi, and many functions, functions in society.

                    <p>Whenever I am free I love to read novels, encyclopedias and other books. I have read a few novels such as Faster Fenay, Hamlet, Murder on the Orient Express and Sacrifice. My favorite authors are Enid Blyton and Agatha Christie. I
                        like novels because we can learn a lot from them, like: Our Increase in Vocabulary. We learn new words when we read them. We do not repeat mistakes. If we read a biography of a person, we learn from the mistake of the person in
                        biography and we do not repeat it in our life.</p>

                    <p>I love listening songs. Music is a therapy, it can heal anyone. It provides me with a good company. One advantage of music ids that there is song for every mood and situation. I hear songs of 70s as well as modern. My favorite singers
                        are Kishore Kumar, Alka Yagnik, Arijit Singh and Neha Kakkar. The apps that I use for listening songs are Gaana and Saavn.</p>

                    <h2>Watching Movies</h2>
                    <p>I also like watching dramas and movies, but I am very choosy and selective in watching movies. I watch movies which provide us with some values and teachings. I think that watching these kind of movies provide lessons to upcoming generations.
                        For example movies like 3 Idiots convey us that do what your heart wants, not something under pressure of someone and many other philosophical teachings. But I do not watch movies often.</p>

            <p class="pt-3 lh-lg">पढाई एक इंसान के लिए बहुत महत्त्वपूर्ण है. मुझे पढाई इसलिए अछि लगाती है क्योंकि उससे हमारा ज्ञान बढ़ता है और हमारा आत्मविश्वास भी बढ़ता है. हमें ज्ञान हर तरफ से मिलता है सिर्फ उसे पहचान कर हमें उसे बटोरना चाहिए. मै पाठशाला में भी हर पाठ्येतर
                गतिसिधि में भाग लेती हु क्योंकि मेरा मानना है की हम उसमे से भी बहुत कुछ सीख सकते है जैसे की जब हम कोई समूह खेल खेलते है तब हम सबके साथ मिलके काम करना सीखते है, और हम बहुत कुछ सीख सकते है. किसी महान पुरुष ने कहा है की, "काबिल होने के लिए
                पढो, फिर कामयाबी ज़रूर तुम्हारा साथ देगी". ए. पी. जे. अब्दुल कलाम ने कहा है, "अगर तुम सूरज की तरह चमकना चाहते हो तो सूरज की तरह जलना भी सीखो".

A person literally cannot live without mobile nowadays. Mobile has a lot of advantages such as we can talk to a person who is far away in other country, state or city, we can listen to
                        songs anytime anywhere, we can find information about anyone, anything literally. We can chat with our friends, family, etc. Mobiles have become an inextricable part of our lives. Even while dining with our family we use phones
                        or even when we hang out with friends everyone is busy in their phones, some updating status, some clicking pictures, etc. But due to these mobile phones we have forgotten to live the moments. We can definitely use mobiles again
                        but we cannot bring those moments back. We don't realize that using mobiles without having any limits is harming us. The rays from the mobile can also cause brain tumor, it also affects a person's sleep. Nowadays when a child or
                        even an infant starts crying the parent gives him/her mobile so that it stops crying. But the rays which mobiles emit can have adverse effects on the child. Most importantly we have become mobile addicts. We have lost the control
                        on ourselves. People become so engrossed in their mobiles that they do not even have time to look in their surroundings. When we go on a holiday or a trip for a break from our hectic lives, we do not give break to our usage of
                        mobiles. Even there we start using mobile instead of enjoying the moment. We can easily chat with someone who is far away from us but we do not even look at the person sitting beside us. Also because of phones we have forgotten
                        to spend quality time with our family. From my perspective we have become slaves of mobile phones. We must learn to utilize it in a proper way so that we can get good benefit out of it and at the same time we can live in the present
                        life.

                    <div class="tab-pane fade" id="list-profile" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="list-profile-list">Teachers play a very important role in a student’s life. A teacher is the one who will help you become a better person and an informed one. Right from kindergarten to university, they are the ones who impart knowledge and teach us about everything important. They assume the role of an educator and caregiver for their students. Sometimes, they also become our friends and help us with personal problems. As a teacher, one must bring out the best in students and inspire them to strive for greatness. Teachers also decide the fate of a nation as the youth is in their hands. When the youth is educated and informed, naturally, the future of the country will be in safe hands.  In fact, the fate of students is in the hands of their teachers. Students are considered as the future of the nation and humankind, and a teacher is believed to be a credible guide for their advancement. Not only do they guide students in academics or extracurricular activities, but teachers are also responsible for shaping a child’s future, making him/her a better human being. Moreover, they see the potential of their students when no one else can. They push the students to achieve greater heights and become successful. A teacher imparts knowledge, good values, tradition, modern-day challenges and ways to resolve them within students. A good teacher is an asset to the students. Moreover, they also teach us about ethical values and imbibe in our moral values. A teacher’s presence in a student’s life can boost their morale and guide them to be more valuable in life. A world without teachers would be definitely chaotic. There are only a few people in our lives who impact our world, and teachers are definitely one of them. Thus, we can say that teachers shape our personality into something very strong and wonderful. In India, we even celebrate Teacher’s Day to honor them on 5th September, every year.

                    <div class="tab-pane fade" id="list-messages" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="list-messages-list">Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the leading cause of death globally. An estimated 17.9 million people died from CVDs in 2019, representing 32% of all global deaths. Of these deaths, 85% were due to heart attack and stroke. Over three quarters of CVD deaths take place in low- and middle-income countries. 
                        In 2016, the estimated prevalence of CVDs in India was estimated to be 54.5 million. One in 4 deaths in India are now because of CVDs with ischemic heart disease and stroke responsible for >80% of this burden. 
                        The WHO prescribes a doctor population ratio of 1:1000.  The doctor-population ratio of the some of the countries are: India - 1:1000, Australia - 3.374:1000, Brazil - 1.852:1000, China - 1.49:1000, France - 3.227:1000, Germany - 4.125:1000, Russia - 3.306:1000, the USA - 2.554:1000, Afghanistan - 0.304:1000, Bangladesh - 0.389:1000, Pakistan - 0.806:1000. 
                        At present, it is estimated that the number of cardiologists in India is 1 for every 300,000 persons. Despite losing 1.7 million lives to heart disease every year, India does not have enough cardiologists to manage the burden. India needs 88,000 cardiologists. 
                        Due to less number of cardiologists, they demand more money which is one of the factory why heart surgeries are expensive. The cost of surgery also depends on many factors, namely: Type of surgery and consumables, equipment required. Expertise of the cardiothoracic surgeon and team. Underlying medical condition of the patient, which can affect the hospital stay, additional tests and medicine requirement.
